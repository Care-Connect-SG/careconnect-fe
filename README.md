# CareConnect Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you install the dependencies when you clone the project for the first time. Use whichever command below corresponding to your favourite package manager:

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (same location as the `package.json` file) to include the environment variables needed for the server to work properly.

```shell
SOON TO BE ADDED
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
